# Smart Contracts

## This project contains list of smart contract I worked on and still working on.

### DNS As an NFT

The Domain Name Service Contract is a contract used to create and deploy domain name as an nft, a user can register a domain with an TLD ending with okedomains, A typical example is vitalik.eth. Now instead of the domain name to be based on eth, it'll be based on okedomains.

### Eth Wallet

The Eth wallet is a smart contract that allows users to deposit Eth inside the smart contract. It's only withdrawable by the contract deployer which is the owner. Users can deposit any amount of eth which must be greater than zero eth.
