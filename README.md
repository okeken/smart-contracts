# Smart Contracts

## This project contains list of smart contract I worked on.

### Eth Wallet 

The Eth wallet is a smart contract that allows users to deposit Eth inside the smart contract. It's only withdrawable by the contract deployer which is the owner. Users can deposit any amount of eth which must be greater than zero eth.

Tests

 - Balance is Zero immediately after deployer
